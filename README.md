Telegram Bot with Webhook

The main task of this bot, to respond to user requests, about the current price of a certain cryptocurrency.

This bot works as follows: The bot accepts the request from the Server Telegrams and the bot processing 
the data sends the data to the server.

This method is effective compared to the reverse method of Webhook (the bot itself requests(spam) telegrams 
server,and the telegram server responds to it), since the delay between the bot and the server almost 
disappears and the unsatisfactory results that could pass between requests disappear.
